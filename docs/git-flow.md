## üî± Branch Strategy

| Branch      | Purpose                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready code. Auto-deployed by Vercel. |
| `dev`       | Integration branch for completed features.      |
| `feature/*` | Feature-specific development branches.          |
| `hotfix/*`  | Emergency fixes branched off `main`.            |

---

## üß± Workflow Steps

### 1. Start a new feature

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Commit your changes

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to format messages:

```
feat(auth): add email OTP verification
fix(dashboard): resolve novel list flicker
```

### 3. Push and open PR

```bash
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

- Open a pull request to `dev`
- Clearly describe what was done and why

### 4. Merge to `dev`

- Review and test thoroughly
- Only merge after approval or self-review if solo

### 5. Deploy to production

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git merge dev
git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Release description"
git push origin main --tags
```

- `main` will trigger a Vercel deployment
